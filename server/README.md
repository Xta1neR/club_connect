## Getting Started

To run the backend server locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the backend folder in your terminal.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend folder and configure environment variables (e.g., database connection URI, JWT secret).
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. After the installation is complete, run `npm start`.
6. The backend server will start running on the specified port (default is `http://localhost:5000`).

## Available Scripts

In the backend folder, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the backend server in production mode.
- `npm run dev`: Runs the backend server in development mode using Nodemon (automatically restarts the server on file changes).
